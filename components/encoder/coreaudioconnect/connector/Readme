This is the connector part of the Core Audio Connect encoder component. It is a Winelib binary that
loads the Core Audio codec installed with iTunes or iCloud in Wine and connects to a running instance
of the Core Audio Connect component via shared memory.

The Core Audio Connect component can load two versions of the connector, a 64 bit or 32 bit variant.
Due to incompatiblities between the Core Audio codecs and recent versions of Wine, the 32 bit variant
is needed in most cases. Building this on a 64 bit system requires some additional steps as only the
64 bit variant is built by default.

Prerequisites
-------------

To successfully build the 32 bit connector on a 64 bit system, the following components are needed in
addition to the components needed to build BoCA and the Wine development tools needed to build the
Core Audio Connect component:

 - A multilib version of g++
 - The 32 bit libwine development package

On Debian based systems, these can be installed using:

 sudo apt install g++-multilib libwine-dev:i386

Building
--------

After building BoCA on a 64 bit system, you should find the following two files belonging to the Core
Audio Connect encoder in the BoCA/bin folder:

 - boca_encoder_coreaudioconnect.1.0.so (the encoder component)
 - boca_encoder_coreaudioconnect64.1.0 (the 64 bit connector part)

To build the 32 bit connector part, enter the following commands:

 cd components/encoder/coreaudioconnect/connector
 make BUILD_X86=True clean
 make BUILD_X86=True

This should create a boca_encoder_coreaudioconnect.1.0 binary in the BoCA/bin folder. To install it,
run the following command:

 sudo make BUILD_X86=True install
